00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:01,710
你是否感到过自己所做的都毫无意义
Do you ever feel like nothing you do matters?

00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:04,430
就像在海滩上留下的脚印
You leave footprints on the beach,

就像不断重复的一天又一天
Like it's just today over again.

11
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:12,460
人们说十几岁时
They say your teen years

12
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:14,860
就是要交朋友、尽情玩耍
are for making friends and having fun...

13
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:17,420
对我来说这样更糟
which made me feel even worse.

14
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:20,270
嗨，艾米，我是杰克
Hey, Amy. It's Jake.

15

咱俩数学课一起上
I'm in your math class.

16
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:24,400
嘿，别忘了给自己买成人纸尿裤
Hey, don't forget your adult diapers.

17
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:35,480

18
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:25,480
呵呵
Yeah, right.

19
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,790
杰克，有电话找你

20
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:38,870
但那一天开始，一切都变了

21
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:43,630
谢谢你送我，雪莉

22
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:46,980
怎么让你去照顾你爷爷呢？
So, how come you have to go deal with your grandpa?

23
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,550
我爸他工作忙，走不开
My dad couldn't get out of work.

24
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:51,790
他还有工作？
I didn't think he worked.

25
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:59,110
我还是给爷爷打个电话吧
I'm just gonna call Grandpa.

26
